Note :- This script is developed for ubuntu based system and might require modifications for other flavours.

1) How to use it?

There will be a file in the same location of the script "logs.txt".That file will have the list of log files that should be deleted after certain interval.
So we have to enter the full path and the name of the log file that should be rotated.

The script will take the list of files from logs.txt, processes it and delete the old logs as per the number of logs.
